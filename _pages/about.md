Welcome! I am a Ph.D candidate in the Department of Political Science at the Univeristy of Pittsburgh. I study International Relations, focusing on International Political Economy and public opinion. My research explores how economic globalization affects politics and vice versa. 

In my dissertation, I primarily focus on the political effects of international migration from the perspective of sending countries. My research agenda also includes the effects of globalization (i.e. trade) on individuals' political attitudes (i.e. anti-immigration sentiment), and how technological changes affect migration patterns and politics.
