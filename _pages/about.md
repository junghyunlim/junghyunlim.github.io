Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. My research is on international/comparative political economy, with a special focus on the politics of migration and globalization. In my work, I use a diverse set of methods including causal inference with observational data, survey experiments, and computational tools like text analysis and machine learning. My work has been published or accepted for publication in *American Journal of Political Science*, *Comparative Political Studies*, *Nature Communications*, and *the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences* among others. 

Previously I was a postdoctoral fellow at Perry World Houseâ€™s Borders and Boundaries Project at University of Pennsylvania (2022-2023), and Princeton University's Niehaus Center for Globalization & Governance (2021-2022). I completed my Ph.D. in Political Science at the University of Pittsburgh in 2021.
