Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Niehaus Center for Globalization and Governance at Princeton University. My work focuses on International and Comparative Political Economy and Political Behavior. I completed my Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Pittsburgh. 

My research explores the effects of economic globalization on politics, with a focus on the political consequences of international migration in sending and receiving countries. In my dissertation, I primarily focus on the causes and consequences of nationalist backlashes and the rise of far-right parties, with a special focus on the impacts of international migration in sending countries. In related projects, I explore the impact of other aspects of economic globalization (i.e. trade) on the rise of radical right-wing populism. 

In my work, I use a diverse set of methods including statistical analysis and causal inference with observational data, experiments, and computational tools such as text analysis and machine learning. My work has been accepted or conditionally accepted for publication in *Comparative Political Studies*, *Electoral Studies*, and *Democratization*.
