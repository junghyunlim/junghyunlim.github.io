Welcome! I am a postdoctoral fellow at Perry World Houseâ€™s Borders and Boundaries Project at University of Pennsylvania. Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow at Princeton University's Niehaus Center for Globalization & Governance (2021-2022). I completed my Ph.D. in Political Science at the University of Pittsburgh in 2021. 

My research is on international/comparative political economy, with a special focus on the politics of international migration and globalization. In my work, I use a diverse set of methods including causal inference with observational data, and computational tools such as text analysis and machine learning. My work has appeared in *Comparative Political Studies*, *Electoral Studies*, and *Democratization*.
