### Dissertation: "Political Consequences of International Migration"

Over the last few decades, the volume of international migrants has continued to grow. According to the World Bank, more than three percent of the world population is living abroad. When migration occurs on such a large scale, what are the political consequences?  My dissertation primarily focuses on the political effects of international migration from the perspective of sending countries. Despite its magnitude, the political outcomes of migration in sending countries have received relatively less attention compared to the immigration politics in receiving countries. In my dissertation, I explore how emigration can influence electoral outcomes, public opinions, and the consolidation of democracy in sending countries.
