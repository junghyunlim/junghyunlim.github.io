Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Niehaus Center for Globalization and Governance at Princeton University. My work focuses on International and Comparative Political Economy and Political Behavior. I completed my Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Pittsburgh. 

My research explores the political implications of globalization and economic development. In my dissertation, I primarily focus on the political consequences of international migration flows in both sending and receiving countries. In related projects, I explore the impact of economic globalization on the rise of radical right-wing populism. My other research agenda aims to understand how technological changes shape local labor markets and individual political behaviors. 

I use a diverse set of data and methods, including surveys, experiments, and computational tools, such as machine learning and text analysis. My work has appeared in Electoral Studies and Democratization.
