Welcome! I am a Ph.D candidate in the Department of Political Science at the University of Pittsburgh. I study international and comparative political economy and political behavior. My research explores the political implications of globalization and economic development. 

In my dissertation, I primarily focus on the political effects of international migration from the perspective of sending countries. My research agenda also includes the impact of globalization on individuals' political behavior and how economic development affects migration flows and politics.
