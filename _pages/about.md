Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. My research is on international/comparative political economy, with a special focus on the politics of migration, labor market, and globalization. In my work, I use a diverse set of methods including causal inference with observational data, and computational tools such as text analysis and machine learning. My work has been published or is forthcoming in *Comparative Political Studies*, *Electoral Studies*, and *Nature Communication* among others. 

Previously I was a postdoctoral fellow at Perry World Houseâ€™s Borders and Boundaries Project at University of Pennsylvania (2022-2023), and Princeton University's Niehaus Center for Globalization & Governance (2021-2022). I completed my Ph.D. in Political Science at the University of Pittsburgh in 2021.
